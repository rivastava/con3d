# Issue Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Shadow Catcher Not Visible
**Root Cause**: Multiple issues:
- Default objects didn't have `castShadow` and `receiveShadow` enabled
- Shadow catcher might not be positioned correctly initially
- UI controls might not be properly connected

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Added `castShadow = true` and `receiveShadow = true` to all default scene objects
- ✅ Enhanced shadow catcher initialization with proper initial positioning
- ✅ Added proper shadow catcher controls in Scene tab
- ✅ Fixed Background Manager API calls that were causing errors

### 2. Camera Switching Not Working
**Root Cause**: 
- Camera switching wasn't updating the main rendering engine camera reference
- Controls object wasn't being properly updated
- Need to synchronize between CameraManager and RenderingEngine

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Added `switchCamera` method to RenderingEngine
- ✅ Added `switchCamera` method to Con3DConfigurator  
- ✅ Updated CameraControls to use proper camera switching API
- ✅ Fixed orthographic camera projection matrix updates

### 3. Default Cameras Missing/Positioning
**Root Cause**:
- Default cameras had poor positioning for orthographic views
- Zoom levels were not appropriate for scene viewing

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Updated default camera positions:
  - Front View: `(0, 0, 15)` with zoom `0.5`
  - Top View: `(0, 15, 0.01)` with zoom `0.5` 
  - Side View: `(15, 0, 0)` with zoom `0.5`
- ✅ Fixed orthographic camera initialization with proper projection matrix updates
- ✅ Ensured proper camera switching between perspective and orthographic modes

## Current Status:

### What Should Work Now:
1. **Shadow Catcher**: 
   - Should be visible as a transparent shadow-receiving plane
   - Toggle on/off in Scene Controls tab
   - Adjustable color, opacity, and size
   - Auto-positions below objects

2. **Camera Management**:
   - Camera tab shows 4 default cameras (Main, Front, Top, Side)
   - Clicking different cameras should switch viewpoint
   - Camera controls should work properly for each view
   - Preview thumbnails should generate

3. **Background Controls**:
   - Scene Controls tab has background management
   - Switch between solid color, gradient, and transparent
   - Real-time color picker updates

### Testing Steps:
1. Open browser at `http://localhost:5174/`
2. Navigate to Scene tab - check for Shadow Catcher controls
3. Navigate to Camera tab - should show 4 cameras with previews
4. Click different cameras - viewpoint should change
5. Try gizmo controls in Lighting tab

## Technical Implementation:

### Files Modified:
- `src/core/ShadowCatcher.ts` - Enhanced initialization
- `src/core/CameraManager.ts` - Fixed camera switching and default positions
- `src/core/RenderingEngine.ts` - Added camera switching support
- `src/core/Con3DConfigurator.ts` - Added camera switching API
- `src/components/CameraControls.tsx` - Fixed camera switching logic
- `src/components/SceneControls.tsx` - Fixed background manager API calls
- `src/App.tsx` - Added shadow casting/receiving to default objects

### Key Features Added:
- Proper camera switching mechanism
- Enhanced shadow system with controls
- Real-time background management
- Gizmo-based lighting controls
- Professional camera management UI

## Next Steps if Issues Persist:

If shadows still aren't visible:
1. Check browser console for any WebGL/Three.js errors
2. Verify shadow map settings in renderer
3. Check if lights are properly casting shadows

If camera switching still doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for camera switching errors  
2. Verify controls update properly
3. Test with different camera types

If camera tab doesn't show cameras:
1. Check if CameraManager is properly initialized
2. Verify default cameras are being created
3. Check preview generation system
