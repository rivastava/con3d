## 🔍 Testing Scenarios
1. **Basic Scene Interaction**
   - Load page → See models → Orbit around → Click to select → Transform

2. **Material Workflow**
   - Select mesh → Open material tab → Choose preset → Apply → See changes

3. **Lighting Workflow**
   - Open lighting tab → Adjust light parameters → Use light linker → See changes

4. **Transform Workflow**
   - Select mesh → Enable transform controls → Use W/E/R → Move/rotate/scale object

5. **Advanced Features**
   - Enable fullscreen → Switch cameras → Export screenshot → Drag/drop model

## 🎯 Success Criteria
