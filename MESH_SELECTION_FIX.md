# Mesh Selection Fix - Page Reload Issue

## Problem
The mesh selection functionality was causing repeated page reloads when clicking on 3D objects. This was due to improper React lifecycle management of event listeners and Fast Refresh conflicts.

## Root Cause
1. **Event Listener Lifecycle**: Mesh selection event listeners were being attached/detached on every render
2. **React Fast Refresh**: The `useCallback` dependency array was causing the selection function to be recreated frequently
3. **Memory Leaks**: Old event listeners weren't being properly cleaned up before new ones were added

## Solution
1. **Moved Event Setup**: Moved mesh selection setup from `useCallback` to direct function call in `handleReady`
2. **Proper Cleanup**: Added `cleanupRef` to track and properly remove event listeners
3. **Lifecycle Management**: Used `useEffect` for component unmount cleanup only
4. **Debouncing**: Added proper event prevention and debouncing to avoid rapid clicks

## Changes Made

### main.tsx
- Removed `useCallback` from mesh selection setup
- Added `cleanupRef` to track cleanup functions
- Moved mesh selection setup to `handleReady` callback
- Added proper cleanup on component unmount
- Improved event listener lifecycle management

### Key Improvements
1. **No React Hot Reload Conflicts**: Event listeners are stable and don't trigger Fast Refresh
2. **Memory Leak Prevention**: Proper cleanup ensures no leaked event listeners
3. **Stable Selection State**: Selection state changes don't cause component re-creation
4. **Better UX**: No more unexpected page reloads when selecting meshes

## Testing
- [x] Build completes without errors
- [x] Dev server starts successfully
- [x] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Mesh selection highlights work
- [x] No page reloads on mesh selection
- [x] Proper cleanup on component unmount

## Verification Steps
1. Click on different 3D objects (cube, sphere, torus, glass cube)
2. Verify highlighting changes without page reload
3. Check browser console for selection logs
4. Verify Transform and Lighting controls work with selected mesh
5. Test drag-and-drop functionality alongside mesh selection

The fix ensures that mesh selection is React-friendly and doesn't interfere with the component lifecycle or cause memory leaks.
