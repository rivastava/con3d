# Gizmo Visibility Fix - Enhanced Debug Version

## Issue
Gizmo (transform controls) is enabled but doesn't show when selecting a mesh. Only appears after toggling off/on in Transform panel.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was likely in the initialization and attachment flow of the NonInterferingTransformControls.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced `attachToMesh` Method
- Ensures transform controls are initialized before attachment
- Auto-enables controls if not enabled
- Forces update after attachment
- Added comprehensive logging

### 2. Improved Initialization Flow
- Set transform controls to invisible by default until attached
- Added logging to track initialization state
- Ensured proper scene addition

### 3. Enhanced Visibility Management
- Better logging for visibility state changes
- Track attached object state
- Clear debugging for troubleshooting

### 4. Improved RenderingEngine Integration
- Added debug logging for attachment attempts
- Track control state during mesh selection

## Debug Output
After refresh, when selecting a mesh, you should see console logs like:
```
ðŸŽ¯ Attempting to attach transform controls to: [MeshName]
ðŸŽ¯ Transform controls attached to: [MeshName]  
ðŸŽ¯ Transform controls visible: true
ðŸŽ¯ Transform controls enabled: true
```

## Testing Instructions
1. Refresh browser at http://localhost:5176
2. Open developer console (F12)
3. Click on a mesh (like the default cube)
4. Check console logs for transform control debug messages
5. Verify if gizmo appears immediately

If gizmo still doesn't appear, the console logs will show exactly where the issue is occurring.

## Additional Quick Fix
If the issue persists, there might be a CSS or rendering layer issue. The transform controls might be behind other objects or not properly rendered in the viewport.
