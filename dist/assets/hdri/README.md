# Placeholder for baseHDRI.hdr

Place your HDRI environment file here: `baseHDRI.hdr`

This file should be an HDR or EXR format environment map that will be loaded as the default lighting environment when the application starts.

To test without an HDRI:
- The application will show a warning in the console but continue to work
- A default environment will be used instead
- You can load HDRI files dynamically through the UI or API
