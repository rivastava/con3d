# Placeholder for baseModel.glb

Place your 3D model file here: `baseModel.glb`

This file should be a GLTF/GLB format 3D model that will be loaded as the default model when the application starts.

To test without a model:
- The application will show a warning in the console but continue to work
- You can load models dynamically through the UI or API
